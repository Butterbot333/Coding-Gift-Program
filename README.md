# Coding-Gift-Program
What it does:
This program takes a code previously given to the user and pulls up a youtube made especially for them and download the video at the end. (To Videos folder)
----------------
How to Send:
This file is a .py but it is meant to be sent as an exe because most likely your friends and family do not have Python installed
Before sending, make and upload youtube videos for each recipient. Make sure to put the secret code at the end of your video so they can continue to the next step of the program (by default the code is 'happy christmas')
When sending, make sure to also give them the ending letters of the youtube link for their video
(eg: https://youtu.be/JzkkXFWqtZ8 --> JzkkXFWqtZ8)
